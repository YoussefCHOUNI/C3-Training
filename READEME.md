# Functions in JS

This is an exercise to practice basic programming principles.

## Instructions

The code of this exercise can be executed via Node.js or in the console tab of your browser's developer tools.

1. Define an `addFavoriteBook(..)` function that receives a single parameter, called `bookName`.

2. If the provided `bookName` string does *NOT* have the word "Great" in it, add it to the `favoriteBooks` array.

	Hints:

	- `someString.includes(anotherString)` will return `true` if `anotherString` is found inside `someString`, or `false` otherwise.

	- Use `!` to negate a boolean value (change `true` to `false` or vice versa).

	- `someArray.push(value)` will add a value to the end of the array.

3. Define a `printFavoriteBooks()` function that receives no parameters.

4. `printFavoriteBooks()` should first print a message like "Favorite Books: ..", and include the number of books in the `favoriteBooks` array.

	Hint:

	- Use the \` back-tick operators for strings that need to include values in them.

	- Use `console.log(..)` to print a message to the screen.

5. Finally, `printFavoriteBooks()` should loop through the `favoriteBooks` array and print out each value.

	Make sure to then call the `printFavoriteBooks()` function at the end of the program.

	Hint: Use the `for ( let .. of .. ) { }` style loop.

# Three Pillars of JS

This is an exercise to briefly practice the three pillars of JS: Types / Coercion, Scope / Closures, and `this` / Prototypes.

## Instructions

The code of this exercise can be executed via Node.js or in the console tab of your browser's developer tools.

1. In the `printFavoriteBooks()` function, make sure there's no accidental type conversion (ie, from number to string).

	Hint: Use `String(..)` to coerce something to a string type.

2. Move the `addFavoriteBook(..)` and `printFavoriteBooks()` functions into the `Bookshelf` class as methods. Modify them so they use the `this` keyword to access the `favoriteBooks` array.

	Hint: `class` methods don't use the `function` keyword, just their name.

3. Fill out the definition of the `loadBooks(..)` function, which should receive an instance of the `Bookshelf` class that you will pass to it.

4. `loadBooks(..)` should call the provided `fakeAjax(..)`, using `BOOK_API` as the URL and an inline function expression as the callback.

5. The callback will be passed an array of book names. Loop through this array, passing each book name to the `addFavoriteBook(..)` method of the `Bookshelf` instance passed to `loadBooks(..)`. Then call the `printFavoriteBooks()` method.

6. Create an instance of `Bookshelf` class, and pass it as an argument to `loadBooks(..)`.

	Hint: Class instantiation: `new Whatever()`.
